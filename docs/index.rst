**mohituQ** (*محيطك*) is an open-source project focused on leveraging quantum algorithms—specifically Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI)—to optimize the placement and routing of trash-collection systems for cleaning up ocean plastic.

Latest version: 0.1.1 (2023)

Project Goals
------------

* Model the logistical challenge of ocean plastic collection as a large-scale optimization problem
* Implement quantum-inspired and classical algorithms (DQI, QAOA, and others) to find optimal solutions
* Support open science and environmental sustainability
