The Ocean Plastic Problem
------------------------

Ocean plastic pollution is one of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time. According to research, more than 8 million tons of plastic waste enters our oceans each year, threatening marine ecosystems, wildlife, and human health.

Current cleanup efforts face significant challenges:

- The vast scale of the oceans
- Dynamic movement of plastic due to currents and winds
- Resource constraints for cleanup operations
- Logistical complexity of deployment and collection

Quantum Optimization Approach
----------------------------

mohituQ leverages quantum computing and quantum-inspired algorithms to address these challenges by:

1. **Modeling the Problem**: Formulating ocean plastic cleanup as a complex optimization problem with multiple objectives
2. **Quantum Algorithms**: Using advanced quantum algorithms like DQI and QAOA to find optimal or near-optimal solutions
3. **Simulation**: Creating realistic models of ocean currents and plastic distribution
4. **Validation**: Comparing quantum solutions with classical approaches to quantify potential advantages
