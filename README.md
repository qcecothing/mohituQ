**Quantum Optimization for Ocean Plastic Cleanup**<br>
mohituQ is an open-source project focused on leveraging quantum algorithms-specifically Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI)-to optimize the placement and routing of trash-collection systems for cleaning up ocean plastic. Inspired by initiatives like The Ocean Cleanup, Plastic Odyssey, and WWF Oceans, this repository aims to accelerate environmental impact through advanced computational techniques.

üåä **Project Goals**<br>
- Model the logistical challenge of ocean plastic collection as a large-scale optimization problem.

- Implement quantum-inspired and classical algorithms (DQI, QAOA, and others) to find optimal or near-optimal solutions for net placement and collection routes.

- Support open science and environmental sustainability by providing transparent, reproducible code and data.

üöÄ **Features**<br>
- Mathematical formulations for multi-objective optimization (maximize plastic collected, minimize environmental impact, etc.)

- Example implementations of DQI and comparative classical algorithms

- Tools for simulating ocean plastic distribution and evaluating cleanup strategies

- Extensible framework for integrating real-world data and collaborating with citizen science initiatives

üåè **UN Sustainable Development Goals:** <br>
This project contributes to the following United Nations Sustainable Development Goals:

- **SDG 3 - Good health and well-being**: Cleaning oceans safeguards human health by reducing exposure to marine pollutants in seafood and coastal waters.
- **SDG 6 - Clean water and sanitation**: Cleaning oceans helps protect marine water quality, which is crucial for resources like desalination and intrinsically linked to effective land-based water management.
- **SDG 11 - Department of Economic and Social Affairs**: Cleaning oceans enhances urban sustainability by tackling marine litter originating from cities, protecting coastal economies, and improving community resilience.
- **SDG 13 - Climate Action**: By optimizing ocean cleanup operations to reduce fuel consumption and emissions while maximizing impact.
- **SDG 14 - Life Below Water**: By directly addressing ocean plastic pollution that threatens marine ecosystems and biodiversity.
- **SDG 17 - Partnerships for Goals**: By fostering open collaboration between quantum computing experts, marine conservationists, and the global community.

## Running the Implementations

### DQI Max-XORSAT Implementation

This implementation uses the Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) approach to solve the Maximum XOR Satisfiability (Max-XORSAT) problem, relevant to network route optimization.

```bash
python src/dqi_max_xorsat_implementation.py
```

### QAOA Implementation

This implementation uses the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to solve optimization problems represented as N√óN matrices.

```bash
python src/implementingQAOA_N_by_N.py
```

You can modify the matrix size by changing the `N` parameter in the script.

### Export Utilities

The repository includes helper modules for result export and visualization:

```bash
python src/simplified_xorsat_export.py
```

## Demo Resources

The `src/demo` directory contains demonstration notebooks and resources to help you understand and visualize quantum algorithms.

## Notes

The implementations showcase different quantum approaches to optimization problems relevant to ocean cleanup logistics. These algorithms can be adapted and scaled to address real-world distribution and collection route optimization challenges.
