Quantum Optimization for Ocean Plastic Cleanup
mohituQ is an open-source project focused on leveraging quantum algorithms-specifically Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI)-to optimize the placement and routing of trash-collection systems for cleaning up ocean plastic. Inspired by initiatives like The Ocean Cleanup, Plastic Odyssey, and WWF Oceans, this repository aims to accelerate environmental impact through advanced computational techniques.

üåä Project Goals
Model the logistical challenge of ocean plastic collection as a large-scale optimization problem.

Implement quantum-inspired and classical algorithms (DQI, QAOA, and others) to find optimal or near-optimal solutions for net placement and collection routes.

Support open science and environmental sustainability by providing transparent, reproducible code and data.

üöÄ Features
Mathematical formulations for multi-objective optimization (maximize plastic collected, minimize environmental impact, etc.)

Example implementations of DQI and comparative classical algorithms

Tools for simulating ocean plastic distribution and evaluating cleanup strategies

Extensible framework for integrating real-world data and collaborating with citizen science initiatives
